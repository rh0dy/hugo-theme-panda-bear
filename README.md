## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1 Requirements

Before starting, please be sure that you have  [installed Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-1-install-hugo).  This theme has been tested against Hugo version `0.78.2`. 

```sh
$ hugo version
Hugo Static Site Generator v0.78.2-959724F0 linux/amd64 BuildDate: 2020-11-13T10:08:14Z
```

### 2.2 Installation

First create your Hugo website using the following command:

```sh
$ hugo new site <website-name>
```
If your Hugo website is under version control using `git`, the easiest way to install this theme is to add it as a [submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules):

```sh
$ cd website-name
$ git submodule add https://github.com/rh0dy/hugo-theme-panda-bear.git themes/hugo-theme-panda-bear
```

Alternatively, you can clone the theme into your Hugo site:

```sh
$ cd website-name
$ git clone https://github.com/rh0dy/hugo-theme-panda-bear.git themes/hugo-theme-panda-bear
```

### 2.3 Configuration

`config.toml` is located in the root of your Hugo website and manages the theme's **menu** and **social icons**. It also manages a whole load of other useful settings, please read [Hugo Configuration Settings](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration) for more information.

```sh
baseurl = "https://website-name.com/"
title = "Website Name"
theme = "hugo-theme-panda-bear"
paginate = 5

[params]
  website_description = "My website!"
```

#### <ins>Menu Configuration<ins>
Use and adapt the sample configuration below to create the menu. Each menu item requires a `name`, `url` and `weight`.  Menu items are displayed in **ascending** weight order.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you [add a new page](#pages) and want to display it on the menu make sure you add a menu item for it.

```sh
[menu]

  [[menu.main]]
    name = "Blog"
    url = "/"
    weight = 0

  [[menu.main]]
    name = "About"
    url = "/about"
    weight = 1

  [[menu.main]]
    name = "Contact Us"
    url = "/contact-us"
    weight = 2

```

#### <ins>Social Links Configuration<ins>

Use and adapt the sample configuration below to display social icons.  Displaying these icons is optional.  If you do use them, they will be appear on the right-hand side of the menu. The `name` value must match the name of any icon from [Font Awesome's free set](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free) of icons. 

```sh
[params]

  [[params.social]]
    name = "twitter"
    url = "https://twitter.com/your-profile"

  [[params.social]]
    name = "github"
    url = "https://github.com/your-profile"
```

### 2.4 Running Hugo

After the theme has been installed & configured, your Hugo website can be generated by running the following command from the root folder of your Hugo website, which outputs files & folders to the  `public` directory (these get uploaded to your webserver):

```sh
$ hugo
```

Alternatively, for local development, run Hugoâ€™s built-in local server from the root folder of your Hugo website and browse to  [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313/) on your server:
```sh
$ hugo server
```


## 3. Adding New Content

All content should support the default [Hugo Shortcodes]([https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/).

### 3.1 Pages

To create a new page, in the root folder of your Hugo website, run the following command:

```sh
$ hugo new <page-name>.md
```

Pages are created within the `content` directory, e.g. `content/<page-name>.md`, and contain the `title`, the `date` it was created and a flag indicating whether or not the page is in `draft`.  

If you want your page to appear in the menu, follow the [Menu Configuration steps](#configuration) to add a menu item for it.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Make sure you change `draft` to `false` when you want to publish the page on your website. By default, pages & posts that are drafts won't be published/displayed on your website.
 
```sh
---
title: "Page Name"
date: 2020-11-23T18:12:28Z
draft: true
---

<Insert your page content here...>
```

### 3.2 Posts

To create a new post, in the root folder of your Hugo website, run the following command:

```sh
$ hugo new post/<post-name>.md
```

Posts are created within the `content/post` directory, e.g. `content/post/<post-name>.md`, and contain the `title`, the `date` it was created and a flag indicating whether or not the page is in `draft`.  

Post also contain a few other optional parameters that are used to provide more information about the post, such as the `author` and the `author_email` . For grouping and organising posts `categories` & `tags` can be used. 

```sh
---
## Important: If this is a draft, then next line should NOT begin with an #.
# draft: true
title: "Post Name"
date: 2020-11-23T18:24:13Z
# Below are your user-defined parameters.
author: "John"
author_email: "john@example.com"
categories: ["personal"]
tags: ["photography", "day trip"]
---

<Insert your post content here...>
```
